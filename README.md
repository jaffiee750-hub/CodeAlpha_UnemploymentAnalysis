# CodeAlpha_UnemploymentAnalysis
This repository contains the Unemployment Analysis Project completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of unemployment trends, including the impact of Covid-19, using Python.


CodeAlpha_UnemploymentAnalysis

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.

 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze unemployment rate trends over time using Python.  
It focuses on identifying seasonal patterns, comparing Covid and non-Covid periods, and visualizing unemployment data for better understanding.

Synthetic monthly unemployment data from **2018 to 2022** is used to simulate real-world unemployment trends.

 Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
---
Key Features:
- Monthly unemployment rate analysis
- Covid vs Non-Covid unemployment comparison
- Seasonal heatmap visualization
- Time-based feature extraction (Year & Month)
- Statistical comparison using average unemployment rates

---
 Methodology
1. Created monthly date range from 2018–2022  
2. Simulated unemployment rates with Covid impact  
3. Built a structured DataFrame using Pandas  
4. Extracted year and month features  
5. Visualized seasonal trends using a heatmap  
6. Compared average unemployment rates during Covid and non-Covid periods  

---
 Visualizations
- Seasonal heatmap showing unemployment rate variations across years
- Color-coded representation of unemployment intensity

---
 Covid Impact Analysis
- Higher unemployment rates observed during Covid-affected years
- Gradual recovery trend noticed in post-Covid period
- Clear difference between Covid and non-Covid average unemployment rates

--
 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of Python for data analysis and visualization to understand unemployment trends.  
It highlights how external factors like Covid-19 significantly impact employment patterns and economic stability.
