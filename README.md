 Unemployment Rate Analysis (2018–2022)

 Overview:

This project performs a time-series analysis of unemployment rates from 2018 to 2022 using Python.
It focuses on identifying overall trends, the impact of COVID-19, and seasonal patterns using data visualization techniques.
The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated to simulate real-world unemployment behavior.
